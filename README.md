A comprehensive guide to mastering Language Integrated Query (LINQ) in C#. This repository provides structured learning materials covering everything from functional programming fundamentals to advanced LINQ operations and performance optimization.

##  What You'll Learn

This repository takes you on a journey through LINQ, starting with functional programming concepts and progressing to advanced query techniques. Whether you're new to LINQ or looking to deepen your understanding, you'll find practical examples and clear explanations for every concept.

##  Course Structure

The repository is organized into progressive lessons, each building upon the previous ones:

### Foundation
- **L01: Pure Vs. Impure Function** - Understand functional programming concepts and side effects
- **L02: Functional Programming** - Apply functional programming principles in C#
- **L03: Core Of LINQ** - Master LINQ fundamentals and query syntax

### Data Operations
- **L04: Projection Operation** - Transform data with Select and SelectMany operations
- **L05: Sorting Data** - Order data with OrderBy, ThenBy, and custom comparers
- **L06: Data Partitioning** - Filter and partition data with Where, Take, Skip operations
- **L07: Quantifiers** - Use Any, All, Contains for boolean queries

### Advanced Querying
- **L08: Grouping Data** - Group and aggregate data with GroupBy operations
- **L09: Join Operations** - Combine multiple data sources with various join types
- **L10: Generation Operations** - Generate sequences with Range, Repeat, Empty operations
- **L11: Element Operations** - Access specific elements with First, Last, Single, ElementAt

### Data Manipulation
- **L12: Equality Operations** - Compare sequences with SequenceEqual and custom equality
- **L13: Concatenation** - Combine sequences with Concat operation
- **L14: Aggregate Operations** - Perform calculations with Sum, Count, Average, Aggregate
- **L15: Sets Operations** - Work with set operations like Union, Intersect, Except

### Advanced Concepts
- **L16: Expression Trees** - Understand and manipulate LINQ expression trees
- **L17: IEnumerable Vs. IQueryable** - Choose appropriate interfaces for in-memory vs database queries
- **L18: Converting Data Types** - Convert between different collection types and LINQ results
- **L19: Custom LINQ Extension Method** - Create reusable LINQ extensions for domain-specific operations
- **L20: LINQ Anatomy** - Deep dive into LINQ implementation and performance considerations
